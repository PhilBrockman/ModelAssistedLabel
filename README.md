           Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary
           to complete the given refs.
    
           You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time you
           push into it, by setting up _h_o_o_k_s there. See documentation for ggiitt--
           rreecceeiivvee--ppaacckk(1).
    
           When the command line does not specify where to push with the
           <<rreeppoossiittoorryy>> argument, bbrraanncchh..**..rreemmoottee configuration for the current
           branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the configuration is
           missing, it defaults to _o_r_i_g_i_n.
    
           When the command line does not specify what to push with <<rreeffssppeecc>>......
           arguments or ----aallll, ----mmiirrrroorr, ----ttaaggss options, the command finds the
           default <<rreeffssppeecc>> by consulting rreemmoottee..**..ppuusshh configuration, and if it
           is not found, honors ppuusshh..ddeeffaauulltt configuration to decide what to push
           (See ggiitt--ccoonnffiigg(1) for the meaning of ppuusshh..ddeeffaauulltt).
    
           When neither the command-line nor the configuration specify what to
           push, the default behavior is used, which corresponds to the ssiimmppllee
           value for ppuusshh..ddeeffaauulltt: the current branch is pushed to the
           corresponding upstream branch, but as a safety measure, the push is
           aborted if the upstream branch does not have the same name as the local
           one.
    
    OOPPTTIIOONNSS
           <repository>
               The "remote" repository that is destination of a push operation.
               This parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS below)
               or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).
    
           <refspec>...
               Specify what destination ref to update with what source object. The
               format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus ++, followed by
               the source object <src>, followed by a colon ::, followed by the
               destination ref <dst>.
    
               The <src> is often the name of the branch you would want to push,
               but it can be any arbitrary "SHA-1 expression", such as mmaasstteerr~~44 or
               HHEEAADD (see ggiittrreevviissiioonnss(7)).
    
               The <dst> tells which ref on the remote side is updated with this
               push. Arbitrary expressions cannot be used here, an actual ref must
               be named. If ggiitt ppuusshh [[<<rreeppoossiittoorryy>>]] without any <<rreeffssppeecc>> argument
               is set to update some ref at the destination with <<ssrrcc>> with
               rreemmoottee..<<rreeppoossiittoorryy>>..ppuusshh configuration variable, ::<<ddsstt>> part can be
               omittedâ€”such a push will update a ref that <<ssrrcc>> normally updates
               without any <<rreeffssppeecc>> on the command line. Otherwise, missing
               ::<<ddsstt>> means to update the same ref as the <<ssrrcc>>.
    
               The object referenced by <src> is used to update the <dst>
               reference on the remote side. By default this is only allowed if
               <dst> is not a tag (annotated or lightweight), and then only if it
               can fast-forward <dst>. By having the optional leading ++, you can
               tell Git to update the <dst> ref even if it is not allowed by
               default (e.g., it is not a fast-forward.) This does nnoott attempt to
               merge <src> into <dst>. See EXAMPLES below for details.
    
               ttaagg <<ttaagg>> means the same as rreeffss//ttaaggss//<<ttaagg>>::rreeffss//ttaaggss//<<ttaagg>>.
    
               Pushing an empty <src> allows you to delete the <dst> ref from the
               remote repository.
    
               The special refspec :: (or ++:: to allow non-fast-forward updates)
               directs Git to push "matching" branches: for every branch that
               exists on the local side, the remote side is updated if a branch of
               the same name already exists on the remote side.
    
           --all
               Push all branches (i.e. refs under rreeffss//hheeaaddss//); cannot be used
               with other <refspec>.
    
           --prune
               Remove remote branches that donâ€™t have a local counterpart. For
               example a remote branch ttmmpp will be removed if a local branch with
               the same name doesnâ€™t exist any more. This also respects refspecs,
               e.g.  ggiitt ppuusshh ----pprruunnee rreemmoottee rreeffss//hheeaaddss//**::rreeffss//ttmmpp//** would make
               sure that remote rreeffss//ttmmpp//ffoooo will be removed if rreeffss//hheeaaddss//ffoooo
               doesnâ€™t exist.
    
           --mirror
               Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs under
               rreeffss// (which includes but is not limited to rreeffss//hheeaaddss//,
               rreeffss//rreemmootteess//, and rreeffss//ttaaggss//) be mirrored to the remote
               repository. Newly created local refs will be pushed to the remote
               end, locally updated refs will be force updated on the remote end,
               and deleted refs will be removed from the remote end. This is the
               default if the configuration option rreemmoottee..<<rreemmoottee>>..mmiirrrroorr is set.
    
           -n, --dry-run
               Do everything except actually send the updates.
    
           --porcelain
               Produce machine-readable output. The output status line for each
               ref will be tab-separated and sent to stdout instead of stderr. The
               full symbolic names of the refs will be given.
    
           --delete
               All listed refs are deleted from the remote repository. This is the
               same as prefixing all refs with a colon.
    
           --tags
               All refs under rreeffss//ttaaggss are pushed, in addition to refspecs
               explicitly listed on the command line.
    
           --follow-tags
               Push all the refs that would be pushed without this option, and
               also push annotated tags in rreeffss//ttaaggss that are missing from the
               remote but are pointing at commit-ish that are reachable from the
               refs being pushed. This can also be specified with configuration
               variable ppuusshh..ffoolllloowwTTaaggss. For more information, see ppuusshh..ffoolllloowwTTaaggss
               in ggiitt--ccoonnffiigg(1).
    
           --[no-]signed, --signed=(true|false|if-asked)
               GPG-sign the push request to update refs on the receiving side, to
               allow it to be checked by the hooks and/or be logged. If ffaallssee or
               ----nnoo--ssiiggnneedd, no signing will be attempted. If ttrruuee or ----ssiiggnneedd, the
               push will fail if the server does not support signed pushes. If set
               to iiff--aasskkeedd, sign if and only if the server supports signed pushes.
               The push will also fail if the actual call to ggppgg ----ssiiggnn fails. See
               ggiitt--rreecceeiivvee--ppaacckk(1) for the details on the receiving end.
    
           --[no-]atomic
               Use an atomic transaction on the remote side if available. Either
               all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated. If the
               server does not support atomic pushes the push will fail.
    
           -o <option>, --push-option=<option>
               Transmit the given string to the server, which passes them to the
               pre-receive as well as the post-receive hook. The given string must
               not contain a NUL or LF character. When multiple
               ----ppuusshh--ooppttiioonn==<<ooppttiioonn>> are given, they are all sent to the other
               side in the order listed on the command line. When no
               ----ppuusshh--ooppttiioonn==<<ooppttiioonn>> is given from the command line, the values
               of configuration variable ppuusshh..ppuusshhOOppttiioonn are used instead.
    
           --receive-pack=<git-receive-pack>, --exec=<git-receive-pack>
               Path to the _g_i_t_-_r_e_c_e_i_v_e_-_p_a_c_k program on the remote end. Sometimes
               useful when pushing to a remote repository over ssh, and you do not
               have the program in a directory on the default $PATH.
    
           --[no-]force-with-lease, --force-with-lease=<refname>,
           --force-with-lease=<refname>:<expect>
               Usually, "git push" refuses to update a remote ref that is not an
               ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it.
    
               This option overrides this restriction if the current value of the
               remote ref is the expected value. "git push" fails otherwise.
    
               Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already published.
               You will have to bypass the "must fast-forward" rule in order to
               replace the history you originally published with the rebased
               history. If somebody else built on top of your original history
               while you are rebasing, the tip of the branch at the remote may
               advance with her commit, and blindly pushing with ----ffoorrccee will lose
               her work.
    
               This option allows you to say that you expect the history you are
               updating is what you rebased and want to replace. If the remote ref
               still points at the commit you specified, you can be sure that no
               other people did anything to the ref. It is like taking a "lease"
               on the ref without explicitly locking it, and the remote ref is
               updated only if the "lease" is still valid.
    
               ----ffoorrccee--wwiitthh--lleeaassee alone, without specifying the details, will
               protect all remote refs that are going to be updated by requiring
               their current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch we
               have for them.
    
               ----ffoorrccee--wwiitthh--lleeaassee==<<rreeffnnaammee>>, without specifying the expected
               value, will protect the named ref (alone), if it is going to be
               updated, by requiring its current value to be the same as the
               remote-tracking branch we have for it.
    
               ----ffoorrccee--wwiitthh--lleeaassee==<<rreeffnnaammee>>::<<eexxppeecctt>> will protect the named ref
               (alone), if it is going to be updated, by requiring its current
               value to be the same as the specified value <<eexxppeecctt>> (which is
               allowed to be different from the remote-tracking branch we have for
               the refname, or we do not even have to have such a remote-tracking
               branch when this form is used). If <<eexxppeecctt>> is the empty string,
               then the named ref must not already exist.
    
               Note that all forms other than
               ----ffoorrccee--wwiitthh--lleeaassee==<<rreeffnnaammee>>::<<eexxppeecctt>> that specifies the expected
               current value of the ref explicitly are still experimental and
               their semantics may change as we gain experience with this feature.
    
               "--no-force-with-lease" will cancel all the previous
               --force-with-lease on the command line.
    
               A general note on safety: supplying this option without an expected
               value, i.e. as ----ffoorrccee--wwiitthh--lleeaassee or ----ffoorrccee--wwiitthh--lleeaassee==<<rreeffnnaammee>>
               interacts very badly with anything that implicitly runs ggiitt ffeettcchh
               on the remote to be pushed to in the background, e.g.  ggiitt ffeettcchh
               oorriiggiinn on your repository in a cronjob.
    
               The protection it offers over ----ffoorrccee is ensuring that subsequent
               changes your work wasnâ€™t based on arenâ€™t clobbered, but this is
               trivially defeated if some background process is updating refs in
               the background. We donâ€™t have anything except the remote tracking
               info to go by as a heuristic for refs youâ€™re expected to have seen
               & are willing to clobber.
    
               If your editor or some other system is running ggiitt ffeettcchh in the
               background for you a way to mitigate this is to simply set up
               another remote:
    
                   git remote add origin-push $(git config remote.origin.url)
                   git fetch origin-push
    
               Now when the background process runs ggiitt ffeettcchh oorriiggiinn the
               references on oorriiggiinn--ppuusshh wonâ€™t be updated, and thus commands like:
    
                   git push --force-with-lease origin-push
    
               Will fail unless you manually run ggiitt ffeettcchh oorriiggiinn--ppuusshh. This
               method is of course entirely defeated by something that runs ggiitt
               ffeettcchh ----aallll, in that case youâ€™d need to either disable it or do
               something more tedious like:
    
                   git fetch              # update 'master' from remote
                   git tag base master    # mark our base point
                   git rebase -i master   # rewrite some commits
                   git push --force-with-lease=master:base master:master
    
               I.e. create a bbaassee tag for versions of the upstream code that
               youâ€™ve seen and are willing to overwrite, then rewrite history, and
               finally force push changes to mmaasstteerr if the remote version is still
               at bbaassee, regardless of what your local rreemmootteess//oorriiggiinn//mmaasstteerr has
               been updated to in the background.
    
           -f, --force
               Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an
               ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. Also, when
               ----ffoorrccee--wwiitthh--lleeaassee option is used, the command refuses to update a
               remote ref whose current value does not match what is expected.
    
               This flag disables these checks, and can cause the remote
               repository to lose commits; use it with care.
    
               Note that ----ffoorrccee applies to all the refs that are pushed, hence
               using it with ppuusshh..ddeeffaauulltt set to mmaattcchhiinngg or with multiple push
               destinations configured with rreemmoottee..**..ppuusshh may overwrite refs other
               than the current branch (including local refs that are strictly
               behind their remote counterpart). To force a push to only one
               branch, use a ++ in front of the refspec to push (e.g ggiitt ppuusshh
               oorriiggiinn ++mmaasstteerr to force a push to the mmaasstteerr branch). See the
               <<rreeffssppeecc>>......  section above for details.
    
           --repo=<repository>
               This option is equivalent to the <repository> argument. If both are
               specified, the command-line argument takes precedence.
    
           -u, --set-upstream
               For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add
               upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less ggiitt--ppuullll(1)
               and other commands. For more information, see bbrraanncchh..<<nnaammee>>..mmeerrggee
               in ggiitt--ccoonnffiigg(1).
    
           --[no-]thin
               These options are passed to ggiitt--sseenndd--ppaacckk(1). A thin transfer
               significantly reduces the amount of sent data when the sender and
               receiver share many of the same objects in common. The default is
               --thin.
    
           -q, --quiet
               Suppress all output, including the listing of updated refs, unless
               an error occurs. Progress is not reported to the standard error
               stream.
    
           -v, --verbose
               Run verbosely.
    
           --progress
               Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default
               when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This
               flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is
               not directed to a terminal.
    
           --no-recurse-submodules, --recurse-submodules=check|on-demand|only|no
               May be used to make sure all submodule commits used by the
               revisions to be pushed are available on a remote-tracking branch.
               If _c_h_e_c_k is used Git will verify that all submodule commits that
               changed in the revisions to be pushed are available on at least one
               remote of the submodule. If any commits are missing the push will
               be aborted and exit with non-zero status. If _o_n_-_d_e_m_a_n_d is used all
               submodules that changed in the revisions to be pushed will be
               pushed. If on-demand was not able to push all necessary revisions
               it will also be aborted and exit with non-zero status. If _o_n_l_y is
               used all submodules will be recursively pushed while the
               superproject is left unpushed. A value of _n_o or using
               ----nnoo--rreeccuurrssee--ssuubbmmoodduulleess can be used to override the
               push.recurseSubmodules configuration variable when no submodule
               recursion is required.
    
           --[no-]verify
               Toggle the pre-push hook (see ggiitthhooookkss(5)). The default is
               --verify, giving the hook a chance to prevent the push. With
               --no-verify, the hook is bypassed completely.
    
           -4, --ipv4
               Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.
    
           -6, --ipv6
               Use IPv6 addresses only, ignoring IPv4 addresses.
    
    GGIITT UURRLLSS
           In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
           address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
           on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.
    
           Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp, and
           ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated;
           do not use it).
    
           The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
           should be used with caution on unsecured networks.
    
           The following syntaxes may be used with them:
    
           Â·   ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
    
           Â·   git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
    
           Â·   http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
    
           Â·   ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
    
           An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:
    
           Â·   [user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/
    
           This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the first
           colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon. For
           example the local path ffoooo::bbaarr could be specified as an absolute path
           or ..//ffoooo::bbaarr to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.
    
           The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username expansion:
    
           Â·   ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/
    
           Â·   git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/
    
           Â·   [user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/
    
           For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
           syntaxes may be used:
    
           Â·   /path/to/repo.git/
    
           Â·   file:///path/to/repo.git/
    
           These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when the
           former implies --local option. See ggiitt--cclloonnee(1) for details.
    
           When Git doesnâ€™t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
           attempts to use the _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_<_t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t_> remote helper, if one exists. To
           explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may be used:
    
           Â·   <transport>::<address>
    
           where <address> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
           URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked.
           See ggiittrreemmoottee--hheellppeerrss(1) for details.
    
           If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
           you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
           will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration
           section of the form:
    
                       [url "<actual url base>"]
                               insteadOf = <other url base>
    
           For example, with this:
    
                       [url "git://git.host.xz/"]
                               insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                               insteadOf = work:
    
           a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be
           rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be
           "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".
    
           If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
           configuration section of the form:
    
                       [url "<actual url base>"]
                               pushInsteadOf = <other url base>
    
           For example, with this:
    
                       [url "ssh://example.org/"]
                               pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/
    
           a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to
           "ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still
           use the original URL.
    
    RREEMMOOTTEESS
           The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as
           <<rreeppoossiittoorryy>> argument:
    
           Â·   a remote in the Git configuration file: $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//ccoonnffiigg,
    
           Â·   a file in the $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//rreemmootteess directory, or
    
           Â·   a file in the $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//bbrraanncchheess directory.
    
           All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line
           because they each contain a refspec which git will use by default.
    
       NNaammeedd rreemmoottee iinn ccoonnffiigguurraattiioonn ffiillee
           You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously
           configured using ggiitt--rreemmoottee(1), ggiitt--ccoonnffiigg(1) or even by a manual edit
           to the $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//ccoonnffiigg file. The URL of this remote will be used to
           access the repository. The refspec of this remote will be used by
           default when you do not provide a refspec on the command line. The
           entry in the config file would appear like this:
    
                       [remote "<name>"]
                               url = <url>
                               pushurl = <pushurl>
                               push = <refspec>
                               fetch = <refspec>
    
           The <<ppuusshhuurrll>> is used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults to
           <<uurrll>>.
    
       NNaammeedd ffiillee iinn $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//rreemmootteess
           You can choose to provide the name of a file in $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//rreemmootteess. The
           URL in this file will be used to access the repository. The refspec in
           this file will be used as default when you do not provide a refspec on
           the command line. This file should have the following format:
    
                       URL: one of the above URL format
                       Push: <refspec>
                       Pull: <refspec>
    
           PPuusshh:: lines are used by _g_i_t _p_u_s_h and PPuullll:: lines are used by _g_i_t _p_u_l_l
           and _g_i_t _f_e_t_c_h. Multiple PPuusshh:: and PPuullll:: lines may be specified for
           additional branch mappings.

           You can choose to provide the name of a file in $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//bbrraanncchheess. The
           URL in this file will be used to access the repository. This file
           should have the following format:
    
                       <url>#<head>
    
           <<uurrll>> is required; ##<<hheeaadd>> is optional.
    
           Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following refspecs,
           if you donâ€™t provide one on the command line. <<bbrraanncchh>> is the name of
           this file in $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//bbrraanncchheess and <<hheeaadd>> defaults to mmaasstteerr.
    
           git fetch uses:
    
                       refs/heads/<head>:refs/heads/<branch>
    
           git push uses:
    
                       HEAD:refs/heads/<head>
    
    OOUUTTPPUUTT
           The output of "git push" depends on the transport method used; this
           section describes the output when pushing over the Git protocol (either
           locally or via ssh).
    
           The status of the push is output in tabular form, with each line
           representing the status of a single ref. Each line is of the form:
    
                <flag> <summary> <from> -> <to> (<reason>)
    
           If --porcelain is used, then each line of the output is of the form:
    
                <flag> \t <from>:<to> \t <summary> (<reason>)
    
           The status of up-to-date refs is shown only if --porcelain or --verbose
           option is used.
    
           flag
               A single character indicating the status of the ref:
    
               (space)
                   for a successfully pushed fast-forward;
    
               ++
                   for a successful forced update;
    
               --
                   for a successfully deleted ref;
    
               **
                   for a successfully pushed new ref;
    
               !!
                   for a ref that was rejected or failed to push; and
    
               ==
                   for a ref that was up to date and did not need pushing.
    
           summary
               For a successfully pushed ref, the summary shows the old and new
               values of the ref in a form suitable for using as an argument to
               ggiitt lloogg (this is <<oolldd>>....<<nneeww>> in most cases, and <<oolldd>>......<<nneeww>> for
               forced non-fast-forward updates).
    
               For a failed update, more details are given:
    
               rejected
                   Git did not try to send the ref at all, typically because it is
                   not a fast-forward and you did not force the update.
    
               remote rejected
                   The remote end refused the update. Usually caused by a hook on
                   the remote side, or because the remote repository has one of
                   the following safety options in effect:
                   rreecceeiivvee..ddeennyyCCuurrrreennttBBrraanncchh (for pushes to the checked out

                   non-fast-forward updates), rreecceeiivvee..ddeennyyDDeelleetteess or
                   rreecceeiivvee..ddeennyyDDeelleetteeCCuurrrreenntt. See ggiitt--ccoonnffiigg(1).
    
               remote failure
                   The remote end did not report the successful update of the ref,
                   perhaps because of a temporary error on the remote side, a
                   break in the network connection, or other transient error.
    
           from
               The name of the local ref being pushed, minus its rreeffss//<<ttyyppee>>//
               prefix. In the case of deletion, the name of the local ref is
               omitted.
    
           to
               The name of the remote ref being updated, minus its rreeffss//<<ttyyppee>>//
               prefix.
    
           reason
               A human-readable explanation. In the case of successfully pushed
               refs, no explanation is needed. For a failed ref, the reason for
               failure is described.

           When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used
           to point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a
           fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.
    
           In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the
           original commit A built on top of is a subset of the commits the new
           commit B builds on top of. Hence, it does not lose any history.
    
           In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history. For example,
           suppose you and somebody else started at the same commit X, and you
           built a history leading to commit B while the other person built a
           history leading to commit A. The history looks like this:
    
                     B
                    /
                ---X---A
    
           Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes leading to
           A back to the original repository from which you two obtained the
           original commit X.
    
           The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to point
           at commit X to point at commit A. It is a fast-forward.
    
           But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch (that now
           points at A) with commit B. This does _n_o_t fast-forward. If you did so,
           the changes introduced by commit A will be lost, because everybody will
           now start building on top of B.
    
           The command by default does not allow an update that is not a
           fast-forward to prevent such loss of history.
    
           If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) or the work
           by the other person (history from X to A), you would need to first
           fetch the history from the repository, create a history that contains
           changes done by both parties, and push the result back.
    
           You can perform "git pull", resolve potential conflicts, and "git push"
           the result. A "git pull" will create a merge commit C between commits A
           and B.
    
                     B---C
                    /   /
                ---X---A
    
           Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and your
           push will be accepted.
    
           Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top of A,
           with "git pull --rebase", and push the result back. The rebase will
           create a new commit D that builds the change between X and B on top of
           A.
    
                     B   D
                    /   /
                ---X---A
    
           Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your push will
           be accepted.
    
           There is another common situation where you may encounter
           non-fast-forward rejection when you try to push, and it is possible
           even when you are pushing into a repository nobody else pushes into.
           After you push commit A yourself (in the first picture in this
           section), replace it with "git commit --amend" to produce commit B, and
           you try to push it out, because forgot that you have pushed A out
           already. In such a case, and only if you are certain that nobody in the
           meantime fetched your earlier commit A (and started building on top of
           it), you can run "git push --force" to overwrite it. In other words,
           "git push --force" is a method reserved for a case where you do mean to
           lose history.

           ggiitt ppuusshh
               Works like ggiitt ppuusshh <<rreemmoottee>>, where <remote> is the current
               branchâ€™s remote (or oorriiggiinn, if no remote is configured for the
               current branch).
    
           ggiitt ppuusshh oorriiggiinn
               Without additional configuration, pushes the current branch to the
               configured upstream (rreemmoottee..oorriiggiinn..mmeerrggee configuration variable) if
               it has the same name as the current branch, and errors out without
               pushing otherwise.
    
               The default behavior of this command when no <refspec> is given can
               be configured by setting the ppuusshh option of the remote, or the
               ppuusshh..ddeeffaauulltt configuration variable.
    
               For example, to default to pushing only the current branch to
               oorriiggiinn use ggiitt ccoonnffiigg rreemmoottee..oorriiggiinn..ppuusshh HHEEAADD. Any valid <refspec>
               (like the ones in the examples below) can be configured as the
               default for ggiitt ppuusshh oorriiggiinn.
    
           ggiitt ppuusshh oorriiggiinn ::
               Push "matching" branches to oorriiggiinn. See <refspec> in the OPTIONS
               section above for a description of "matching" branches.
    
           ggiitt ppuusshh oorriiggiinn mmaasstteerr
               Find a ref that matches mmaasstteerr in the source repository (most
               likely, it would find rreeffss//hheeaaddss//mmaasstteerr), and update the same ref
               (e.g.  rreeffss//hheeaaddss//mmaasstteerr) in oorriiggiinn repository with it. If mmaasstteerr
               did not exist remotely, it would be created.
    
           ggiitt ppuusshh oorriiggiinn HHEEAADD
               A handy way to push the current branch to the same name on the
               remote.
    
           ggiitt ppuusshh mmootthheerrsshhiipp mmaasstteerr::ssaatteelllliittee//mmaasstteerr ddeevv::ssaatteelllliittee//ddeevv
               Use the source ref that matches mmaasstteerr (e.g.  rreeffss//hheeaaddss//mmaasstteerr) to
               update the ref that matches ssaatteelllliittee//mmaasstteerr (most probably
               rreeffss//rreemmootteess//ssaatteelllliittee//mmaasstteerr) in the mmootthheerrsshhiipp repository; do the
               same for ddeevv and ssaatteelllliittee//ddeevv.
    
               This is to emulate ggiitt ffeettcchh run on the mmootthheerrsshhiipp using ggiitt ppuusshh
               that is run in the opposite direction in order to integrate the
               work done on ssaatteelllliittee, and is often necessary when you can only
               make connection in one way (i.e. satellite can ssh into mothership
               but mothership cannot initiate connection to satellite because the
               latter is behind a firewall or does not run sshd).
    
               After running this ggiitt ppuusshh on the ssaatteelllliittee machine, you would ssh
               into the mmootthheerrsshhiipp and run ggiitt mmeerrggee there to complete the
               emulation of ggiitt ppuullll that were run on mmootthheerrsshhiipp to pull changes
               made on ssaatteelllliittee.
    
           ggiitt ppuusshh oorriiggiinn HHEEAADD::mmaasstteerr
               Push the current branch to the remote ref matching mmaasstteerr in the
               oorriiggiinn repository. This form is convenient to push the current
               branch without thinking about its local name.
    
           ggiitt ppuusshh oorriiggiinn mmaasstteerr::rreeffss//hheeaaddss//eexxppeerriimmeennttaall
               Create the branch eexxppeerriimmeennttaall in the oorriiggiinn repository by copying
               the current mmaasstteerr branch. This form is only needed to create a new
               branch or tag in the remote repository when the local name and the
               remote name are different; otherwise, the ref name on its own will
               work.
    
           ggiitt ppuusshh oorriiggiinn ::eexxppeerriimmeennttaall
               Find a ref that matches eexxppeerriimmeennttaall in the oorriiggiinn repository (e.g.
               rreeffss//hheeaaddss//eexxppeerriimmeennttaall), and delete it.

               Update the origin repositoryâ€™s master branch with the dev branch,
               allowing non-fast-forward updates.  TThhiiss ccaann lleeaavvee uunnrreeffeerreenncceedd

               situation, where a fast-forward is not possible:
    
                               o---o---o---A---B  origin/master
                                        \
                                         X---Y---Z  dev
    
               The above command would change the origin repository to
    
                                         A---B  (unnamed branch)
                                        /
                               o---o---o---X---Y---Z  master
    
               Commits A and B would no longer belong to a branch with a symbolic
               name, and so would be unreachable. As such, these commits would be
               removed by a ggiitt ggcc command on the origin repository.
    
    SSEECCUURRIITTYY
           The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from
           stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
           shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a
           malicious peer, your best option is to store it in another repository.
           This applies to both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on
           a server are not effective for read access control; you should only
           grant read access to a namespace to clients that you would trust with
           read access to the entire repository.
    
           The known attack vectors are as follows:
    
            1. The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects it has
               that are not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to
               optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker
               chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isnâ€™t
               required to send the content of X because the victim already has
               it. Now the victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends
               the content of X back to the attacker later. (This attack is most
               straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by creating a
               ref to X in the namespace the client has access to and then
               fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it on a
               client is to "merge" X into a public branch and hope that the user
               does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the
               server without noticing the merge.)
    
            2. As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim
               sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker
               falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a
               delta against X. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to
               Y to the attacker.

![base64 splash](https://github.com/PhilBrockman/ModelAssistedLabel/blob/master/modelassistedlabel%20splash.jpg?raw=true)

## Background

Object detection is great! ... if your labeled dataset already exists. I wanted to use machine learning to turn my regular rowing machine into a "smart" rowing machine (specifically: I want to track my workout stats).

Unfortunately, I was unable to find a suitable existing set of labeled LCD digits.

After working through [a Roboflow tutorial]( https://models.roboflow.com/object-detection/yolov5), I started to use Roboflow to annotate and store my images. 

And I hated annotating my images by hand. Once the models began making reasonable guesses, I enlisted the model's help in labeling new images. This repository is the result of these efforts.

(Later on, I developed a [custom React annotator](https://github.com/PhilBrockman/autobbox) as a curiousity. However, I labeled dozens upon dozens of images with Roboflow and would recommend their free annotation service.)

## Getting Started

```python
#Fresh colab installation:

!git clone https://github.com/PhilBrockman/ModelAssistedLabel.git
%cd "ModelAssistedLabel"
!pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ModelAssistedLabel==1.1
```

### Expected Inputs:
* Both 
  - **labeled images**
      + All of the images and labels must be in a common folder (subfolders allowed).
      + labels must be in [YOLOv5 format](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark/issues/60#issuecomment-401854885).
{% include note.html content='Image/label pairs are based on their base filename. For example `image.jpg/image.txt` would be paired as would `other_image5.jpg/other_image5.txt`.' %}
* And:
  - **unlabeled images**





```python
# these images have already had the images labeled and verified by a human
labeled_images   = "./Image Repo/labeled/Final Roboflow Export (841)"

unlabeled_images_repos = [] #including a variety of lighting from three seperate recordingns
unlabeled_images_repos.append("Image Repo/unlabeled/21-3-18 rowing 8-12 /")
unlabeled_images_repos.append("Image Repo/unlabeled/21-3-22 rowing (200) 1:53-7:00")
unlabeled_images_repos.append("Image Repo/unlabeled/21-3-22 rowing (200) 7:50-12:50")

unlabeled_images = unlabeled_images_repos[2] #for the sake of example, I'm selecting the images with the best lighting
```

### Expected Output:

* ***ZIP file*** that contains: 
    - `images/`
      + a copy of every image in **Unlabeled Data**
    - `labels/`
      + result of running object detection on each image
    - a results folder produced by Ultralytic's `train.py` on the **Labeled Data** (if not using pre-trained weights)
    - `classmap.yaml` to preserve the identity of the classes


## Configure defaults

Several values are stored by the `Defaults` class. Any value can be overridden (and new values can be added. Make sure to `save()` any changes!

```python
from ModelAssistedLabel.config import Defaults

d= Defaults()
print(" -- Defined Keys: --")
print("\n".join([x for x in d.__dict__.keys()]))
```

     -- Defined Keys: --
    config_file
    root
    split_ratio
    data_yaml
    resource_map
    trainer_template


Speciy the absolute path of the root directory.

```python
!pwd
```




    '/content'



```python
d.root = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Coding/ModelAssistedLabel/"
```

Save any changes

```python
d.save()
```

Enter root directory

```python
import os
os.chdir(Defaults().root)
```

Clone yolov5 repo and install requirements.

```python
Defaults.prepare_YOLOv5()
```

    Setup complete. Using torch 1.8.0+cu101 _CudaDeviceProperties(name='Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB', major=6, minor=0, total_memory=16280MB, multi_processor_count=56)


## Processing input

Next, the images need to be written in a way so that the Ultralytics repository can understand their content. The `Autoweights` class both organizes data and create weights. Running an "initialize" command makes changes to the disk.

```python
ls
```

## Generate Weights

With the images written to disk, we can run the Ultralytics training algorithm. On this dataset, I found 1200 epochs to be a reasonable stopping point but using even longer training times are not uncommon.

```python
%%time

    'yolov5/runs/train/<index>'



The results folder is stored as an attribute as well, and it has a lot of data stored therein.

```python
aw.last_results_path, len(os.listdir(aw.last_results_path))
```




    ('yolov5/runs/train/<index>', 20)



However, the weights are stored in a subfolder called (aptly) "weights". I use `best.pt`.

```python
os.listdir(aw.last_results_path + "/weights")
```




    ['last.pt', 'best.pt']



View the last couple lines 

```python
with open(aw.last_results_path + "/results.txt") as results_file:
  results = results_file.readlines()
print("Epoch   gpu_mem       box       obj       cls     total    labels  img_size")
results[-5:]
```

    Epoch   gpu_mem       box       obj       cls     total    labels  img_size

## Labeling a new set of images

The names of my classes are digits. Under the hood, the YOLOv5 model is working of the index of the class, rather than the human-readable name. Consequently, the identities of each class index must be supplied.

```python
#aw.last_results_path + "/weights/best.pt"
from ModelAssistedLabel.detect import Viewer

class_idx = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '0']
v = Viewer("pre-trained weights/21-2-25 1k-digits YOLOv5-weights.pt", class_idx)
```

    Fusing layers... 


```python
import random

images = [os.path.join(unlabeled_images, x) for x in os.listdir(unlabeled_images)]
```

```python
%matplotlib inline 
for image in random.sample(images,3):
  v.plot_for(image)
```

## Exporting annotated images

```python
project_name = "seven segment digits"
outzip = Defaults._itername(project_name)
os.mkdir(outzip)
print(outzip)
```

    seven segment digits3


Store the class labels with index 0 on line 1, index 1 on line 2, and so on.

```python
with open(os.path.join(outzip, "label_map.txt"), "w") as label_map:
  label_map.writelines("\n".join(class_idx))
```

Ensure that image/label pairs have a common root filename

```python
import random, PIL
salt = lambda: str(random.random())[2:]

for result in results:
  #generate a likely-to-be-unique filename
  shared_root = Defaults._itername(f"{project_name}-{salt()}")

  #save the image to the outfile
  image = PIL.Image.open(result["image path"])
  image.save(os.path.join(outzip, f"{shared_root}.jpg"))

  #save the predictions to the outfile
  predictions = result["predictions"]
  with open(os.path.join(outzip, f"{shared_root}.txt"), "w") as prediction_file:
    prediction_file.writelines("\n".join([x["yolov5 format"] for x in predictions]))
```

## Next Steps

After letting the YOLOv5 model take a stab at labeling, I would then adjust these predictions manually before absorbing them to the training data. While I built (an admittedly janky) labeler to perform my touchups, There are certaintly a number of other anntotation tool available.

I've only used one commerical annotation tool and that would be Roboflow's annotator. Roboflow was a great tool for me to use when I was starting off.
