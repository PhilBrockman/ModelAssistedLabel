# Model-asisted Labeling with YOLOv5
> bootstrapping image annotation


![base64 splash](https://github.com/PhilBrockman/ModelAssistedLabel/blob/master/modelassistedlabel%20splash.jpg?raw=true)

## Background

Object detection is great! ... if your labeled dataset already exists. I wanted to use machine learning to turn my regular rowing machine into a "smart" rowing machine (specifically: I want to track my workout stats).

Unfortunately, I was unable to find a suitable existing set of labeled LCD digits. So I began using my webcam to campture images of my rowing screen.

After working through [a YOLOv5 tutorial]( https://models.roboflow.com/object-detection/yolov5), I started to use Roboflow to annotate and store my images. But I hated annotating my images by hand. Once the models began making reasonable guesses, I enlisted the model's help in labeling new images. This repository is the result of these efforts.

(Later on, I developed a [custom React annotator](https://github.com/PhilBrockman/autobbox) as a curiousity. However, I labeled dozens upon dozens of images with Roboflow and would recommend their free annotation service.)

## Getting Started

{% include tip.html content='[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PhilBrockman/ModelAssistedLabel/blob/master/index.ipynb)' %}

```
# clone this repository
!git clone https://github.com/PhilBrockman/ModelAssistedLabel.git
%cd "ModelAssistedLabel"
```

### Expected Inputs:

-  **labeled images**
    + All of the images and labels must be in a common folder (subfolders allowed).
    + labels must be in [YOLOv5 format](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark/issues/60#issuecomment-401854885).
    + I provide 841 annotated images.
{% include note.html content='Image/label pairs are based on their base filename. For example `image.jpg/image.txt` would be paired as would `other_image5.jpg/other_image5.txt`.' %}





```
# these images have already been labeled
labeled_images   = "Image Repo/labeled/Final Roboflow Export (841)"
```

  - **unlabeled images**
    * I provide 3 sets of unlabeled images under `Image Repo/unlabeled`.

```
# these images need to be labeled
unlabeled_images = "Image Repo/unlabeled/21-3-22 rowing (200) 1:53-7:00"
```

### Expected Output:

* **Folder** that contains: 
    - `images/`
      + a copy of every image in **Unlabeled Data**
    - `labels/`
      + result of running object detection on each image
    - a results folder produced by Ultralytic's `train.py` on the **Labeled Data** (if not using pre-trained weights)
    - `class labels.txt` to preserve the identity of the classes


```
from ModelAssistedLabel.config import Defaults
import os

project_name = "seven segment digits"
export_folder = Defaults._itername(project_name)

print(export_folder)
```

    seven segment digits3


```
#make the export folder
os.mkdir(export_folder)

#make the images and labels subfolders
for resource_folder in ["images", "labels"]:
  os.mkdir(os.path.join(export_folder, resource_folder))
```

## Configure defaults

Several values are stored by the `Defaults` class. Any value can be overridden (and new values can be added. Make sure to `save()` any changes!

```
d= Defaults()
print(" -- Defined Keys: --")
print("\n".join([x for x in d.__dict__.keys()]))
```

     -- Defined Keys: --
    config_file
    root
    split_ratio
    data_yaml
    resource_map
    trainer_template


Speciy the absolute path of the root directory.

```
!pwd
```

    /content/ModelAssistedLabel


```
d.root = "/content/ModelAssistedLabel/"
```

Save any changes and enter root directory

```
d.save()
d.to_root()
```

These following 11 lines regarding seting up the Ultralytics are taken from [the Roboflow tutorial]( https://models.roboflow.com/object-detection/yolov5).

## Processing input

Next, the images need to be written in a way so that the Ultralytics repository can understand their content. The `Autoweights` class both organizes data and create weights. Running an "initialize" command makes changes to the disk.

```
from ModelAssistedLabel.train import AutoWeights

datadump="ipynb_tests/index"

aw = AutoWeights(name="<index>", out_dir=datadump, MAX_SIZE=200)
aw.initialize_images_from_bag(labeled_images)
aw.traverse_resources()
```

    
    dirs ['./train', './valid', './test']

    	 > 40 files
    test/images
    	 > 20 files
    test/labels
    	 > 20 files
    File:  data.yaml


## Generate Weights

With the images written to disk, we can run the Ultralytics training algorithm. On this dataset, I found 1200 epochs to be a reasonable stopping point but using even longer training times are not uncommon.

```
%%time
aw.generate_weights(1000)
```

    CPU times: user 10.5 s, sys: 1.45 s, total: 11.9 s
    Wall time: 45min 23s





    'yolov5/runs/train/<index>'



The results folder is stored as an attribute as well, and it has a lot of data stored therein.

```
import os
aw.last_results_path, len(os.listdir(aw.last_results_path))
```




    ('yolov5/runs/train/<index>', 20)



However, the weights are stored in a subfolder called (aptly) "weights". I use `best.pt`.

```
os.listdir(aw.last_results_path + "/weights")
```




    ['last.pt', 'best.pt']



View the last couple lines 

```
with open(aw.last_results_path + "/results.txt") as results_file:
  results = results_file.readlines()
print("Epoch   gpu_mem       box       obj       cls     total    labels  img_size")
results[-5:]
```

    Epoch   gpu_mem       box       obj       cls     total    labels  img_size

## Labeling a new set of images

The names of my classes are digits. Under the hood, the YOLOv5 model is working of the index of the class, rather than the human-readable name. Consequently, the identities of each class index must be supplied.

```
class_idx = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '0']
```

And the `Viewer` class doesn't care how recently your weights were generated so you can plug in existing weights.

```
from ModelAssistedLabel.detect import Viewer

results_folder = aw.last_results_path
#results_folder = 'yolov5/runs/train/<index>' #uncomment to run with pre-trained weights

weight_path = results_folder + "/weights/best.pt"

v = Viewer(weight_path, class_idx)
```

    Fusing layers... 


Selects all images in the unlabeled folder and let's us look through the computer's eyes at the images.

```
%matplotlib inline 
import random, glob

images = glob.glob(f"./{unlabeled_images}/*.jpg")

for image in random.sample(images,3):
  v.plot_for(image)
```

```
results = []
for image in images:
  results.append(v.predict_for(image))
```

## Exporting annotated images

Store the class labels with index 0 on line 1, index 1 on line 2, and so on.

```
with open(os.path.join(export_folder, "label_map.txt"), "w") as label_map:
  label_map.writelines("\n".join(class_idx))
```

Ensure that image/label pairs have a common root filename

```
import random, PIL, shutil
salt = lambda: str(random.random())[2:]

for result in results:
  #generate a likely-to-be-unique filename
  shared_root = Defaults._itername(f"{project_name}-{salt()}")

  #save the image to the outfile
  image = PIL.Image.open(result["image path"])
  image.save(os.path.join(export_folder, "images", f"{shared_root}.jpg"))

  #save the predictions to the outfile
  predictions = result["predictions"]
  with open(os.path.join(export_folder, "labels", f"{shared_root}.txt"), "w") as prediction_file:
    prediction_file.writelines("\n".join([x["yolov5 format"] for x in predictions]))

  #check if weights were generated
  if aw is not None and os.path.exists(aw.last_results_path):
    print("Moving yolov5 results folder")
    shutil.move(aw.last_results_path, export_folder)
  else:
    print("No weights to save")
```

## Wrap up

With the class wrappers built around Ultralytic's YOLOv5 libraries, models can now be programmically generated. Even with the time and resource constrainst of Colab Pro, I was still comfortably able to train a YOLOv5 model on 841 images for 2000 epochs (weights are available under `./pre-trained weights/841 rowing images.pt`)

And with that model, I can achive my original goal (under certain conditions)! If I employ blackout curtains and carefully adjust the lamps lighting the room, I can reliably read the LCD display.

You can see the sensitivity to environmental conditions in these training sets under `Image Repo/unlabeled/`
